## User Story
As a freelance web developer, I would love to have a convenient way to create simple logos for my projects.

It would be amazing to have a tool that simplifies the process of creating logos, making it accessible and enjoyable for developers like me.

With a tool like this, I can add an affordable and professional touch to my websites and projects.

## Acceptance Crieteria
- The command-line application should accept user input.
- When prompted for text, the user should be able to enter up to three characters.
- When prompted for the text color, the user should be able to enter a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.
- When prompted for a shape, the user should be presented with a list of shapes to choose from, including circle, triangle, and square.
- When prompted for the shape's color, the user should be able to enter a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.
- After entering input for all the prompts, an SVG file named logo.svg should be created.
- The command line should display the output text "Generated logo.svg".
- When the user opens the logo.svg file in a browser, they should see a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria they entered.
